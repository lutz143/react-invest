                            Nominal's platform makes investment analysis easy with the incorporation of several machine learning and statistical techniques via python.
                            Nominal utilizes a value-based investment approach, mapping and forecasting key Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) metrics to derive Nominal (NOM),
                            Conservative (CON), and Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) positions to assess a stock price Confidence.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to DCF, nominal empowers the investment community to have a dialogue around what constitutes a good investment.
                            <span style={{ fontStyle: 'italic' }}>  'Market Reactions'</span> enables the generation of ideas and continual feedback via comments.
                            Additionally, future functionality will look to expand the power of sharing ideas as nominal continues to evolve.
